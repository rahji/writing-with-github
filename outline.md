# Git and GitHub for Technical Writing

## Overview

* We want to do some technical writing, collaboratively.
* We also want to be able to keep track of all of our contributions and changes.
* We want to easily publish that information at the end.
* Version control, in the form of Git, can help us with this.
* GitHub is a service that works with Git to make things easier and more publicly accessible.
* In addition, we will use Microsoft Visual Studio Code because it allows us to easily edit text. It also makes using Git and GitHub easier.
* While this collection of tools is typically used for writing and managing *code*, they can be really useful for *any* kind of writing project.
