# A Workflow for Writing Alone

Even though part of our initial goal is to figure out a system for writing collaboratively, the setup that we've got can also be effective for technical writing individually.

* Committing with Git will still provide the ability to track changes to the writing.
* Visual Studio Code and its extensions provide an excellent environment for writing well-organized text with Markdown.
* GitHub provides others access to your writing, including rendered Markdown and an automatically-generated custom website.
